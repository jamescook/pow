P O W !  ( Not like prisoner of war, but from the movie Step Brothers where that guy from the Daily Show is saying "POW" repeatedly. )

Override your 'puts' for fun shell coloring.

Install (with gemcutter as sauce):
  sudo gem install jamescook-pow

Usage:
  require "pow"

Examples:
  puts.yellow "Hello world in yellow"
  puts.red    "Hello world in red" 
  puts.red!   "Hello world in red, but with boldness"
  puts.red_   "Hello world in red, but with underscore"
  puts.rainbow "Hellow world, but more silly."


TODO:
 - Figure out if you can bold a 'dark' color
