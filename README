P O W ! 

Override your 'puts' for fun shell coloring.

Install (with gemcutter as sauce):
  sudo gem install jamescook-pow

Usage:
  require "pow"

Examples:
  puts.yellow "Hello world in yellow"
  puts.red    "Hello world in red" 
  puts.red!   "Hello world in red, but with boldness"
  puts.red_   "Hello world in red, but with underscore"
  puts.rainbow "Hello world, but more silly."

  puts_       "Hello world, underscored."
  puts!       "Hello world, bold."

  puts        "Hello world, and I can highlight matches.", :match => "can"
  puts        "Hello world, and I can highlight matches with a specific color.", :match => "can", :match_color => :purple

  p.red "Hello world, but less typing .. also red."
  p! "Hello world, in bold"
  p! "Mix and match", :color => :purple, :background => :black


You can also set defaults in your ~/.irbrc or wherever.
  require 'pow'
  Pow.defaults = {:bold => true}  # Now any puts will default to bold


There's a script included that you can pipe text into and output customized text:
  cat README | ruby bin/ruby-pow --bold --background=purple
